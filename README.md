# fedora-asahi-cinnamon

Because I'm occasionaly wiping my macbook M1 air to test new Fedora builds on it:  
https://github.com/leifliddy/asahi-fedora-builder

I started this project to automate the provisioning of a newly built M1 system.  
So everything is geared towards my preferences.  
You'll obviously need to modify things to suit your needs.  

```salt``` isn't the most readable or intuitive configuration management system, but it's really powerful (and it's what I know)  
Hopefully, you can sort of understand how it works by looking at the state files (.sls) in this project.  

If you have any questions on how to implement something in ```salt```, please let me know and I'll try to help you out.
